    <p>When I first became vegetarian, I was sad. My family is from the Philippines and I grew up on food cooked by my mom and grandma. Filipino food tends to be reliant on
        meat. Luckily, mushrooms can actually make a great meat replacement, specifically oyster, shiitake, and king trumpet mushrooms. Mushrooms, when cooked right, can 
        pack an umami punch! Combined with the traditional ingredients of a chicken or pork adobo, I think mushroom adobo can serve as a satisfying alternative. </p>
        <p>Disclaimer: This is not my recipe. The original may be found <a href="https://www.diasporaco.com/blogs/recipes/coconut-milk-mushroom-adobo"> here! </a> There are a couple changes I made.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 pounds mixed mushrooms, torn or cut into bite sized pieces</li>
            <li>5 tablespoons of coconut oil</li>
            <li>2 large shallots, cut into 1/4 slice inches</li>
            <li>12 cloves of garlic, peeled and smashed lightly (cloves should still remain whole)</li>
            <li>1 1/2 teaspoons of ground black peppercorns</li>
            <li>1/3 cup of soy sauce</li>
            <li>1/3 cup of coconut vinegar</li>
            <li>6 - 8 fresh, whole bay leaves</li>
            <li>cooked rice (optional)</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Instructions:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat a large Dutch oven or heavy-bottomed pot over medium high heat. Add two tablespoons of coconut oil and continue to heat for 30 seconds.</li>
            <li>Add half the mushrooms, stirring to coat in the oil and then let them cook, undisturbed, until they begin to caramelize on one side, about 2–3 minutes. Give the mushrooms a stir and continue to cook until they begin to brown on the other side, about another 2–3 minutes. </li>
            <li>Remove the cooked mushrooms and transfer them to a large plate or bowl. Repeat with the remaining half of the mushrooms, transferring the cooked mushrooms to the same plate or bowl. Set aside the cooked mushrooms</li>
            <li>Reduce the heat to medium and add the last tablespoon of coconut oil to the Dutch oven or pot. Add the shallots and garlic and cook until they start to soften, about 2–3 minutes. Add the ground peppercorn.</li>
            <li>Add the soy sauce, coconut vinegar, bay leaves and reserved mushrooms (and any mushroom juices that may have accumulated) to the pan and stir to combine. Reduce the heat to medium low and cook until the sauce reduces and flavors meld, about 45–55 minutes.</li>
            <li>To serve, spoon some of the mushrooms and sauce over cooked rice.
            </li>

        </ol>
