    <p>One of the first vegetarian recipes I learned was chana masala. In fact, Indian/Southern Asian food in general is absoluetely a God-send for vegetarians and vegans!
        Chana masala in particular is my favorite. Chickpeas are pretty high in protein and fiber, so they make you feel more satisfied compared to other vegetarian foods 
        in my opinion. I've been trying to increase my tolerance to spicy foods, but Indian spicy is a whole &#39;nother level, so I modified it a bit &#40;hence 	
        &lsquo;butchered&rsquo;&#41;. This also follows Adam Ragusea's recipe, which can be found <a href="https://cookpad.com/us/recipes/13910141-chana-masala">here!</a> Again, I made my own changes to it. 
        Hope you enjoy!
